# SBCARS Overview

The Brazilian Symposium on Software Components, Architectures, and Reuse (SBCARS) is promoted by the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC). It brings together researchers, students, and professionals with a wide range of interests in topics related to Software Engineering, including software product lines, component-based software development, software architecture, and software reuse. Started in 2007, SBCARS is the successor to the series of six Brazilian Workshops on Component-Based Development (WDBC), which began in 2001. With several editions already held, its contributions to the national scientific calendar have solidified it as a significant technical and scientific event in the software sector.
